# Bike Sales Analysis
The main goal of this project is to use Excel to create a dashboard that will analyze bike sales count data across different regions, occupations, and factors that influence the demand for bikes.

I completed a number of tasks in order to meet the project's objective.
Firstly, I familiaried myself with the dataset.
I then carried out formatting, find and replace, and data cleaning to get rid of any duplicates, spaces, and special characters.
To extract more data from the dataset, custom columns called Age Brackets were created.
In order to summarize the data, quickly obtain important information visually, and facilitate understanding, pivot tables, charts, and graphs were created.
In the end, I created an Excel dashboard that uses slicers to let users interact with the data and see it in various ways.
Important observations:
For men, the maximum average income is $60,124. Thus, they bought more bikes than women, who made 7% less money overall.
Those in the Middle Ages (ages 31 to 54) bought four times as many bikes as those in the Adolescent and Older age groups.
Bicycle purchases are more common for commutes that are shorter (0â€“1 miles) than those that are longer (10 miles or more).
